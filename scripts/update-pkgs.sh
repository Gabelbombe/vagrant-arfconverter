# Swallow the return code from `apt-get install` above. This is a hack,

# a non-zero return code from `apt-get install`. It seems as though
# the desktop environment still works in the face of these error (no
# problems seen during brief testing); so we just swallow this error and
# return success. Otherwise, vagrant provisioning would catch the error
# code and halt the provisioning process.
